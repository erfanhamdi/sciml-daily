# SciML Paper Scraper — Project Context & Requirements

## What this is

A **daily new-paper scraper/curator** for **Scientific Machine Learning (SciML)**,
**AI for Scientific Computing**, and **AI for Applied Math**. Think *HuggingFace Daily
Papers*, but narrowed to **only** these fields — NOT the broad "AI for Science" umbrella.

Dual purpose:
1. A personal tool the author reads every morning.
2. A public open-source product shipped on GitHub for the community.

## Hard constraints

- **Low cost, budget-monitored.** The only paid dependency is the LLM: **DeepSeek-R1 on AWS
  Bedrock**, called via the Bedrock **Converse** API. Every run logs requests used + cumulative
  **token usage** to a maintainer-only file so spend stays visible. Hosting/runner stay free.
- **Runs in the cloud, daily, unattended** — must keep working when the laptop is closed.
  Target runner: **GitHub Actions scheduled workflow** (free *and unlimited* for public
  repos). No always-on server, no VPS.
- **Open-source friendly:** two AWS secrets (`AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` / `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`) so a
  forker with Bedrock access can run it. (Forks need their own AWS account with DeepSeek-R1 enabled.)
- **Keep it simple and clean.** Minimal options/config, no premature abstraction, no
  provider-swapping layers. **Bedrock-hosted DeepSeek-R1 is the only model.** One source of truth
  for the taxonomy/keywords/categories. Favor a few small, focused modules over flexibility nobody asked for.

## Decisions locked in

- **Runner:** GitHub Actions cron (daily). Output is a static artifact committed back to
  the repo / deployed from it.
- **Output formats (v1):** a single-page **web app** (HF Daily Papers style) — a full-width,
  responsive **card grid** browsable by a **date strip** (latest selected by default), plus a
  separate **Search** tab (title/author text search + multi-select subfield-tag filter). Built as
  one `index.html` shell + a `data.json` payload rendered client-side. **RSS and the archive page
  were removed** (superseded by the date strip + search). A daily email digest is still deferred.
  - README-only output was **rejected** (becomes an unscrollable wall with many papers).
- **v1 = comprehensive daily filtered index. NO ranking / "Top picks."** Ranking is
  explicitly **deferred** to a later version (no community upvotes on day 0; ranking would
  need LLM relevance scoring / personal-interest match / trending signals — out of scope for v1).
- **Scope style:** *wide net within the methods space, with per-paper subfield tags*
  ("wide but tag subfields"). Each paper gets one or more subfield tags so the site can
  filter/collapse by subfield.
- **Classification:** **DeepSeek-R1 on AWS Bedrock** (currently inference profile `us.deepseek.r1-v1:0`
  in `AWS_REGION`; both live in the one config file, so version/region bumps are a one-line change),
  called via boto3's Bedrock **Converse** API. R1 is a reasoning model, so we read only the answer
  `text` blocks (dropping its reasoningContent) and use a smaller `BATCH_SIZE` (20) so reasoning
  tokens don't truncate the JSON. The **one and only** LLM — not swappable, no provider abstraction
  (keep it simple). **No embeddings.** (LLM task spec below.)
- **Credentials handling:** keys are **never committed**. Stored as **GitHub Actions encrypted
  secrets** (`AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` / `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`), injected at runtime via `env:`,
  auto-masked in logs. Forks/outside PRs do not receive them. boto3 picks them up automatically;
  local runs read them from a **`.gitignore`d `.env`** file. (Add `.env` to `.gitignore` from day one.)
- **Gray-zone rule (method applied to a science domain):** **include on any methods overlap.**
  Keep a paper if it touches SciML / applied-math / scientific-computing **methods** at all,
  even when demonstrated on a domain (e.g. a neural operator tested on weather). The broad
  "AI for Science" *domain* papers (bio/protein, materials, chemistry, drug discovery,
  climate, medicine) are **out of scope** unless a SciML/applied-math method is the actual
  contribution.
- **Sources (v1):** **arXiv** (free API) over a **generous but specific category set** —
  cs.LG, cs.NA, cs.AI, cs.CL, cs.CE, stat.ML, math.NA, math.OC, math.DS, math.AP, math.PR, math-ph,
  physics.comp-ph, physics.flu-dyn, eess.SY (editable in `config.ARXIV_CATEGORIES`). **Measured live
  2026-06: ~400–600 papers/day** across this set. Precision comes from the **keyword prefilter +
  LLM**, not from narrowing categories further. **+ OpenReview** (ICLR/NeurIPS submissions).
  Cross-source **dedup** required. More categories/sources later.
- **Tech stack:** **Python** end-to-end — fetch + prefilter + LLM classify + render.
  **Jinja2** templates → **static HTML** deployed free on **GitHub Pages**. Light vanilla JS
  for client-side tag filtering/search. One language, cohesive, $0 hosting.

## Deferred to later versions (explicitly out of v1)

- **Ranking / "Top picks"** — LLM relevance scoring, personal-interest match, trending signals.
- **Daily email digest** — add a free send path later (e.g. Resend free tier, or Gmail SMTP
  app password), reusing the curated daily set. Must stay short + link to the site.
- **More sources** — Semantic Scholar, Papers with Code, etc., beyond arXiv + OpenReview.

## In-scope subfield taxonomy (the classifier's target tags — editable config)

- **Operator learning** — neural operators (FNO, DeepONet, graph/transformer operators),
  geometry-aware operators on manifolds
- **PDE foundation models** — pretrained-on-many-PDEs, fine-tunable (Poseidon, SPUS, CompNO, P3)
- **Physics-informed ML** — PINNs, PINO, deep energy methods, + numerical analysis/convergence
  theory of them
- **Generative models for simulation** — diffusion models for PDEs/turbulence, probabilistic
  surrogates, physics-informed (spectral) diffusion
- **Differentiable simulation** — differentiable physics, hybrid physics–neural surrogates
- **ML-accelerated numerical methods** — learned/meta-solvers, accelerating legacy solvers,
  reduced-order modeling
- **Equation discovery & dynamical systems** — symbolic regression, **SINDy**, neural ODEs,
  Koopman/DMD, operator discovery
- **LLMs & agents for math / sci-computing** — LLM agents for PDEs & scientific computing,
  self-evolving scientific agents, autoformalization & LLM theorem proving (AlphaProof-style),
  LLMs generating solver code
- **Mathematical analysis of LLMs / neural nets** (tag `mathematical-analysis-of-llm`) —
  applied-math theory of LLMs: training & attention dynamics, mean-field / interacting-particle
  views, expressivity, approximation, convergence, stability, generalization bounds, geometry of
  in-context learning. IN for the *mathematical* content, **not** the LLM topic. (Refs:
  arXiv 2312.10794, 2512.01868, 2410.05218, 2410.02724.)
- **UQ & inverse problems** — uncertainty quantification, Bayesian SciML, inverse problems,
  data assimilation
- **Foundations** — Gaussian processes for scientific computing, AI–HPC hybridization

### Out of scope (unless the contribution is a SciML/applied-math method)
Domain "AI for Science": biology/protein, materials, chemistry, drug discovery, climate/weather,
medicine. Also generic ML/LLM papers with no scientific-computing/applied-math angle.

## LLM task spec (DeepSeek — the only LLM call)

The LLM has **two jobs** per candidate paper (already past the cheap prefilter): (1) classify it
in/out of scope and assign subfield tags, and (2) write a **two-sentence summary** — sentence one
states the specific problem the paper investigates, sentence two states its key method/innovation
(specific, using the paper's own terminology; the most important points of this paper, not
background). No ranking or rewriting beyond that summary.

- **Input per request (one paper):** `title`, `abstract`, `categories` (arXiv cats / OpenReview venue).
- **Fixed instruction (system prompt, identical every call):** scope definition + gray-zone rule
  ("include on any methods overlap") + out-of-scope domain list + the **allowed subfield tag list**
  (model must pick only from these).
- **Output (JSON, prompt-enforced; tolerant parser handles fences/wrappers):**
  ```json
  { "in_scope": true,
    "tags": ["operator-learning", "pde-foundation-models"],
    "summary": "Solving many PDE families with one model is hard. Introduces a neural operator pretrained across PDE families and fine-tunable to new ones." }
  ```
  `tags` empty when `in_scope` is false. `summary` = two sentences, shown as the site card blurb.
- **Execution (batched):** classify **N papers per request** (batch size in config, e.g. 20) — the
  user message is a numbered list, the output a JSON **array** of `{id, in_scope, tags, summary}`.
  Latency is irrelevant to us, so batching is pure upside: it cuts requests ~N× and ~N× the cost
  (≈100–200 candidates/day → ~5–10 requests). The tolerant parser strips code fences / wrapper
  objects. Sequential with a small delay; throttling-aware stop/resume. (See "BATCH MODE" in `prompts/classify.md`.)

## LLM cost & monitoring (cheap, and watched)

Bedrock bills per token. The design keeps spend tiny and **visible to the maintainer**:

- **Classify once, ever.** Persist each classification keyed by paper ID (arXiv id / OpenReview id).
  Daily runs call the LLM only on *new, unseen* papers — overlapping categories and re-runs never
  re-classify. Steady-state requests = new papers that day. (The seen-store is `data/papers.json`;
  `main.run` diffs fetched ids against it, so no paper is ever sent to Bedrock twice.)
- **Prefilter before the LLM.** Category + keyword prefilter cuts the firehose ~5–10× before any
  API call; only plausible candidates are classified.
- **Batched.** ~100–200 candidates/day → batches of ~20 → ~5–10 requests.
- **Maintainer-only run log.** Every run appends a record to `data/stats.json` and prints a summary:
  fetched / candidates / classified / in-scope / deferred, **requests used**, and **cumulative token
  usage (in/out)** for the run (Bedrock has no balance endpoint, so token count is the spend signal;
  accumulated in `classify._USAGE`). This is the daily budget monitor — it is **not** rendered on the
  public site. (Note: in a public repo, the run log and Actions output are world-readable.)
- **Per-run safety cap** `MAX_REQUESTS` (config, ≈200) so a conference-deadline spike can't run up
  the bill in one run. Overflow is **carried to the next day** (unseen papers stay queued; a daily
  feed loses nothing by deferring). Log how many were deferred.
- **Pacing:** a small delay between calls (config `REQUEST_DELAY`) to avoid Bedrock throttling.
- **Clean stop/resume:** the runner catches **throttling/quota errors** (HTTP 429, ThrottlingException)
  and halts cleanly, leaving the rest *unseen* so they retry next run. A spike only delays papers;
  it never loses them or silently overspends.

**Daily volume funnel (measured 2026-06):** ~400–600 papers *fetched* from the generous category
set (cheap API pulls, seconds) → ~400–600 *new after dedup + seen-filter* → ~100–200 *candidates*
(keyword prefilter) → **batched ~20/request → ~5–10 LLM requests** → ~40–120 *in-scope* shown on
the site, each tagged so you can narrow to the subfields you care about. Total runner time ≈ 5–10
min/day. Only the Bedrock calls cost money, billed per token.

The prompt itself lives in `prompts/classify.md` (approved separately).

## Pipeline shape (high level)

`fetch (arXiv + OpenReview) → dedup → cheap prefilter (categories + keywords) → LLM classify
in/out + assign subfield tags + write a two-sentence summary → store daily set → render the
single-page web app (index.html shell + data.json, browsable by date strip + search) → deploy to
GitHub Pages` — all orchestrated by a daily GitHub Actions cron, for the cost
of a few Bedrock (DeepSeek-R1) calls (free hosting/runner).
